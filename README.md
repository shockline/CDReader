# CDReader
+ **C**onvolutional **D**iscrete Reader.
+ It's just someone's Graduation design.
+ Unfortunately in Coding. Not finished yet.

### Dependency
+ [Python](http://www.python.org/)
+ `Theano` + `Numpy` For `GPU_Calculating`
+ `urllib2` Replaced with `urllib.request` in `python3.x`
+ `ConfigParser`  Replaced with `configparser` in `python3.x`

### New Idea
- [ ] Maybe there should be a starter.
- [ ] Make a `Configure` out of Source Code.
- [ ] Really need a cool word which starts with 'D' for 'CDReader', seriously.
